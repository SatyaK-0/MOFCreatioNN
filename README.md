<H2> Introduction </H2>
MOFCreatioNN is an advanced computational framework designed to facilitate the design and cost estimation of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are a class of porous materials with a wide range of applications, including gas storage, separation, and catalysis. The framework leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models, including Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (CGCNNs) and a novel Crystal Scalar Input Convolutional Graph Neural Network (CSICGNN), to predict material properties and estimate costs based on elemental composition.

<H2> Features </H2>
Cost Estimation Dataset: A comprehensive dataset estimating the cost of each element in their common industrially used form.

Trained CGCNN Modules: Pre-trained Crystal Graph Convolutional Neural Network models for predicting MOF properties.

Novel CSICGNN Architecture: A new neural network architecture designed to incorporate scalar inputs alongside graph-based data for enhanced prediction accuracy.

<H2> Novel Architecture: Crystal Scalar Input Convolutional Graph Neural Network</H2>
The Crystal Scalar Input Convolutional Graph Neural Network (CSICGNN) is a novel architecture developed to enhance the prediction capabilities of traditional CGCNNs. By incorporating scalar inputs such as temperature and pressure, the CSICGNN can provide more accurate predictions under varying environmental conditions.

<H3> Key Features of CSICGNN </H3>
Scalar Input Integration: Allows for the inclusion of environmental conditions and other scalar parameters.

Enhanced Accuracy: Improved prediction accuracy by considering both graph-based and scalar data.

Flexibility: Can be adapted to various prediction tasks by modifying the scalar inputs.

<H3> Architecture Overview </H3>
The CSICGNN architecture consists of:

Graph Convolutional Layers: To process the crystal graph structure.

Scalar Input Layers: To integrate scalar inputs into the network.

Fully Connected Layers: To combine graph and scalar features for final predictions.
